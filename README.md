# Counter Forms Character Set

Here is the minimum character set covered by all Counter Forms typefaces. It is based on Christoph Koeberlinâ€™s excellent [Latin-M Character Set](https://github.com/koeberlin/Latin-Character-Sets) with a few additions to ensure it supports all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages.

## Glyphs Filter

Place the `CustomFilter Counter Forms.plist` in the same directory as a Glyphs file to access the character set from within Glyphs.
